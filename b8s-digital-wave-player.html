                            <p> I have an old Olympus VN-960PC digital voice recorder (DVR). I upload recordings from it to PC via USB, using Windows or Linux software (https://raywoodcockslatest.wordpress.com/2016/05/15/linux-vn960pc/). So far, I am not finding a way to upload from the DVR to a new Fire HD 8 tablet. My Linux is a little rusty, but am I correct in thinking I can't run as root in the Fire, and therefore can't install the Linux software. According to the automatically gernerated subtitles on youtube, these are the most used words from PLA shows. 28513 the 27359 i 21476 you 19489 a 17908 to 15575 and 12021 that 9509 in 8929 it 8713 on 8043 for 7864 i'm 7567 is 7002 like 6863 know 6033 your 6031 this 5627 me 5560 have 5207 just 5092 so 4950 not 4887 yeah 4727 okay 4703 but 4701 are 4600 don't I want hoist on Vinyl. Why don't they at least release all the studio stuff on Vinyl. I understand live stuff but studio. ###Thank you so much for Platinum! I'm flabbergasted! Hi there everyone, this is a post that will kontain all of the best/better AI point assignments for each kharacter, tournament and kustom ability loadouts submitted by players included! Big shoutout to the original post from the Injustice 2 days (https://www.reddit.com/r/INJUSTICE/comm ents/6cnu3y/compiled_list_of_ai_builds/), I used this heavily trying to match playstyles together. I don't play with the entire roster Hey there everyone! I often see people asking where to start when getting into prog metal, so I thought instead of answering every one of them individually I'd make a list. I'm not going into too much depth because otherwise this will become endless, but I'll try to give a brief explanation of all styles I'm going over. So let's get started! #Part 0: Some information on the genre and motivation Since this guide got as huge as it did, I felt it was necessary to write a better introd.

# Greetings, first heroes of the Pantheon! My name is Uros Banjesevic, I am the creative director of Pagan Online from Mad Head Games studio, which means I am responsible for your gameplay experience. With this post I want to start the tradition of having knowledge and idea exchanges between you, players, and us, developers. This exchange will take many forms and will be done by several people from Pagan Online team, responsible for different aspects of your experience inside and outside. Max Level Players: We want end game content Epic: War games Max Level Players: Surprised Pikachu face Nobody: Epic: Here's a new event quest line with 100% fetch quests with Canny Valley quest line RNG All jokes aside I want to give my thoughts on the 9.0 update after about 12 hours of play time. Positives: More missions added to Twine Twine map expanded More Twine mission rewards with Perk-up Longer alert timer. NAME: Countdown to Extinction PREMISE: MODUS has detected a defective rogue mainframe that's trying to take control of the nuclear stockpile and unleash hell on Appalachia. You must breach the control substation, take out the mainframe's defenses, and stop the launch before Appalachia experiences another nuclear Armageddon. BASICS: This dungeon consists of three linear sections. Players progress from section to section by either defeating a specific mechanic or destroying the secti. What's up my fellow agents! So last week I did a Sharpshooter guide (https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b5edwv/sharpshooter_pve_end_game_gun_build_solo_level_4/) and it received much praise on this subreddit. It was truly very humbling, thank you so much for that . In light of Tidal Basin and WT5 coming out, I wanted to share with you guys what the end game version of this build looks like , i.e. with the highest rolled Model 700, MK17 and gear talents Some non tcg players, some had played HS before, some played other mtg videogames and hated them (like I did) and some old mtg irl players who rejected the digital format. I approached each one of these individuals detailing the quality of the game, in terms of design, programming and seriousness about sets and formats. And absolutely praising the f2p format and telling them how you can build any deck you want in a month or less completely free if you do all weeklies or play some of the constr. Reddit only allows us two stickies, so this is now two threads in one! Please post your MSPaint builds as comments here — new threads made for them will be removed and redirected to this thread. The compiled 3.6 info below is also still being updated, and I'll keep updating it until we know everything. Brand New Info (check this section daily to stay up to date) As far as I'm aware we now know everything. This post will be taken down tomorrow. The Golden. 
## What this is: This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter board game projects that are either: - newly posted in the past 7 days , or - ending in the next 7 days (starting Apr 08) and have at least a fighting chance of being funded. All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (The occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!) Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between midnight and noon PST. ## Ending. PREFACE: I have a large digital music library and pride myself on keeping a well-organized library. A well-lived life is in large part a matter of context, reflecting specific needs that are conditional on other particularities of life, and a well-organized library is the same in its individuality. There is no one true path that is better than any other: there are parallel paths, working alongside one another to give shape to the impossible. We will never find the one true path that “works. All prices include shipping to the US (with the exception of Hawaii and Alaska). I always give discounts on purchases of multiple games/consoles. Feel free to make your own offer on multiple items. The only prices that aren't negotiable are individual items. If you are from Canada, please see the note at the bottom of the post. Beyond Canada, I do not ship internationally at this time. This post is organized as follows. There's a TON here, so please check out everything, as items </p>
